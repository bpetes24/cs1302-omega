## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a friendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

This app is a JavaFX implementation of the game "Pong!", which involves two players
hitting a ball back and forth until one misses, earning the other a point. If one
player earns enough points, then they win the game.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned all about how to update object positions to simulate movement in the game,
which was exciting to see once I was able to make it work.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I would have started sooner, as I had little time to complete the game before the
deadline, and I had a myriad of other time commitments and assignments pulling me
away from it. Still, I hope to continue working on the game after this class so
that I may finish it and make it into something I'm proud of.
